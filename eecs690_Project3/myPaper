For my project I wrote the code in OpenCl.  In doing this I created my work group size to be the product of the rows and columns.  I did this because it created one thread for a "box" of points.  It did create a few extra threads that were at the end of the data points (thus only would have two points instead of 4 and not creating a box) and I ignored them by including an if statement that checked for that.  The threads used were able to locally deal with a set of four points in their "box" and do the computations with just those points.  I felt that one thread per box was all that was needed since more threads per box would not speed anything up. The extra threads would not be able to do anything extra at the same time to help speed up any of the calculations since all the comparisons involved all the points and knowing exactly which one was above and below the level.
